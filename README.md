<h1>Encryption & Decryption Challenge</h1>

Welcome!

Description:
Work in an application that encrypts texts, so you can exchange secret messages with other people who know the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" that we will use are the following:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

Requirements:
	- It must work only with lowercase letters
	- Letters with special accents or characters should not be used
	- It should be possible to convert a word for the encrypted version also return an encrypted word for its original version.

Extras:
A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text to the transfer section, i.e. it has the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option in the application menu.

Enjoy!
